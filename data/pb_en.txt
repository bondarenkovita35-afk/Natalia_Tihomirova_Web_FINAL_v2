Personal Letter — Application for Team Manager (PostNord TPL)

Hello,

I am applying for the Team Manager position at PostNord TPL. I currently work as a team leader and have a strong understanding of daily operations, processes and the requirements for high quality, efficiency and leadership.

In my role I take responsibility, prioritise correctly and ensure that the work is delivered according to set goals. I am used to working under pressure, handling changes and making decisions with a focus on structure, clarity and results.

I lead with presence and clarity and thrive in supporting, guiding and following up employees in their daily work. For me, clear communication, accountability and fairness are key foundations for a well‑functioning team. I work solution‑oriented and can see both details and the overall impact on results.

I see the Team Manager role as a natural next step and I want to contribute to improved workflows, high delivery quality and a stable, sustainable working environment. I am motivated by organisations with clear goals, strong values and high ambitions, and I view PostNord TPL as a workplace where I can contribute and create long‑term value.

I look forward to the opportunity to present myself and my engagement in a personal meeting.

Kind regards,
Natalia Tihomirova
